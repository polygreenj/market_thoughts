Trump Tariff (event-driven); written mid-Feb 2025, edited mid-Mar 2025

In the US market, the reaction could be mainly reflected by interest rates, yield curve, equity markets and currency markets.

- Equity: will the sell-off spread
Corporate earnings will likely be down particularly those involving supplies from China Mexico and Canada, thereby we expect a lower equity performance. 
Every five-percentage-point increase in the US tariff rate is estimated to reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by roughly 1-2%. (source: xxxxx)


- Forex: weaker or stronger dollar
USD becomes stronger as the tariff persists. (The import goods are more expensive so people will just consume domestic goods, so less foreign currency needed) (another reason: Tariffs are inflationary, elevated inflation expectations cause yields to rise, and in the short term rising yields cause the dollar to strengthen as people buy dollars to receive those higher yields)


- Fixed Income: 
What we so far witnessed is that higher inflation rate could price in fewer rate cuts, or even higher front-end rates; tightening financial conditions. We are expect a generally flat yield curve: short-term rates rise while long-term rates are weighted down by weakened growth expectation.
